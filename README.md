# Task 6 - Create and Evaluate Strong Passwords

## Objective
Understand password strength, test multiple passwords, and learn best practices for secure password creation.

## Steps
1. Created 5 passwords with different complexity levels.
2. Tested each using online strength checkers (PasswordMeter, Security.org).
3. Recorded scores, time-to-crack, and feedback.
4. Summarized best practices for creating strong passwords.

## Results
| Password | Strength Score (%) | Time to Crack | Feedback |
|----------|--------------------|---------------|----------|
| password123 | 49% | <1 second | Too short, common word |
| P@ssw0rd! | 82% | 1 hour | Common word base, needs length |
| H@ckTh3!Cyb3r$2025 | 85% | Millions of years | Strong length & complexity |
| &uV4@Xx9pR2qL8^dT | 95% | Trillions of years | Excellent randomness |
| M@ch!n3L3arn1ng_Cyb3r#X | 100% | Practically unbreakable | Very strong |

## Key Learnings
- Always use 12+ characters with a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
- Avoid dictionary words and predictable patterns.
- Use passphrases or password managers.
- Enable MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) for extra security, its a extra layer of security beyond just a username and password.
